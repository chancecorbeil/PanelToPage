PanelToPage
===
Version 1.3

Organize pages and posts as featured panels on your home page. Write different text for pages and the panels on the home page. Reorder the panels by setting a numerical value. Have complete control of your home page layout, features, and calls to action.

This theme assists featuring pages and posts on the home page, without using an excerpt of the page contents. Instead, featured panels can be fully customized with a WordPress editor. Customize the theme colors, fonts, and other controls from the theme customizer.
